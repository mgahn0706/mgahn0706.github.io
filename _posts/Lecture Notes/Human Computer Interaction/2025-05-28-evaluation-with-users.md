  - Human Computer Interaction

Now, test an interface with real users! (종강 전 마지막…)  
  
- Users are human beings… not simulator  
    - Ethics  
    - Responsibilities!  
  
### Types of User testing  
  
- Qualitative / Naturalistic  
- Quantitative / Experimental  
- Field study (완성도가 높아야 가능)  
  
---  
  
### Participant standpoint  
  
- Testing is a distressing experience.  
    - Pressure to perform  
    - Feeling inadequacy  
    - Looking like a fool

## Milgrams’ Obedience Experiment  
  
authority figure + social peer group이 70%이상이 영향을 준다는 연구.  
  
→ 근데 윤리적이지가 못함  
  
- Deceived participants.  
- put them under more pressure than many believe was necessary  
  
Was it useful? → Did we anything learned that can be broadly applied? 너 재미로 그냥 호기심에 한거 아냐?  
  
Was it ethical? → 다른 윤리적인 방법이 없었을까? 상황을 다 설명해준다던지. 역할극을 해본다던지.

## Treating Subjects with `respect`  
  
Follow human subject protocols  
  
- Individual test results should be `confidential`  
- Users can `stop` the test any time  
- Users are aware the `monitoring technique`  
- Their performance will not have `implication on their life` (승진 금지)  
- Records will be `anonymous`  
  
Use standard `informed consent form`nnnb  
  
---  
  
## Conducting Experiment  
  
Before experiment  
  
- Have them read and sign consent form  
- Explain goal of experiment  
  
During experiment  
  
- Stay `neutral`  
- Never indicate displeasures (한숨쉬기. 에휴 너무 못쓰네 ㅉㅉ 금지)  
  
After the experiment  
  
- Debrief users  
- Inform users about goal  
- Answer any questions!  
  
---  
  
## Managing Subjects  
  
- Don’t waste users’ time  
    - Use `pilot tests` to debug experiments!  
    - Have everything ready  
- Make user comfortable  
    - Keep a relaxed atmosphere  
    - allow breaks  
    - pace tasks correctly  
- Compensation  
    - Pay them!

## Concerns of User Testing  
  
### Internal Validity  
  
- Observed result by independent variables.  
- Confidence in our explanation  
- Usually good in experimental setting  
- watch for `confounding` variables  
  
다른 영향 없이, 해당 실험에서 수행 능력이 independent variable (p  
  
### External Validity  
  
다른 환경, 다른 대상에게도 적용되는거야?  
  
- Generalizability.  
- confidence that results applies in real situation  
  
→ These two has trade-off.  
  
### Reliability  
  
이 실험 똑같은 상황에서 반복해도 똑같은 결과가 나올까?  
  
---  
  
## Considerations on…  
  
### Internal Validity  
  
- Ordering effect  
    - X먼저? Y 먼저?  
    - Learning effect!  
    - Get tired…  
- Selection Bias  
    - 무작위로 고른 줄 알았는데, 나눈 집단에 bias가 있을 수 있음  
- Experiment Bias  
    - 실험 수행자가 자기가 원하는 결과로 해석하는 경향성  
  
→ Double-blind experiment (내 주제가 뭔지 모르게 conductor를 고용)  
  
### External Validity  
  
- Population  
    - Target population을 잘 반영할만한 사람인가?  
- Ecological Validity  
    - Real world와 환경 세팅이 얼마나 같은가?  
- Training validity  
    - 너무 튜토리얼을 많이 알려준거 아닌가?  
- Task validity  
    - 실험에서 진행한 task들이 실제로 사람들의 활동을 대표하는가?

## Qualitative Evaluation  
  
The raw data is `non-numeric` data.  
  
- Observations, video  
- Open-ended interviews  
- Narrative, textual description  
  
→ We should focus on how good it is, richness and depth of data. (not reduction to numbers)  
  
### Grounded Theory approach  
  
- Data-driven method for building theory from qualitative data  
- Aim: generate new theory grounded in the data itself

## Usability Study - Qualitative  
  
**목적**  
  
Understand the user’s perception  
  
Emphasize the users’ ability to use the system  
  
**방법**  
  
- Introspection (cognitive walkthrough)  
- Direct observation  
- Interviews and questionnaires  
  
일단 task를 만든다.  
  
- End goals  
- Specific and realistic  
- Doable  
- Not too long  
  
### Cognitive walkthrough (Introspection)  
  
Designer tries the system out (without users)  
  
- Completely Subjective  
- Designer is non-typical user  
  
### Direct Observation  
  
Observing users interacting with system  
  
- Good for identifying gross design/interface problems  
  
→ need to code  
  
Three approaches  
  
- Simple observation  
- Think-aloud  
- Constructive interaction  
  
1. **Simple observation**  
    - Evaluator observes!  
    - Drawbacks  
        - No insight into the user’s decision process or attitude  
2. **Think aloud**  
    - Subject asked to say what they are thinking  
    - Widely used  
    - Drawbacks  
        - Awkward for subject, not natural  
        - Thinking about it may alter the way people perform their task  
        - Hard to talk when they are concentrating.  
3. **Constructive Interaction Method**  
    - Two people work together on a task  
    - Normal conversation between the two user is monitored (less distortion)  
        - Removes awkwardness of think-aloud  
    - Co-discovery learning  
        - Use coach and naive subject together  
        - Make naive subject use the interface  
    - Drawbacks  
        - Need good team!  
  
### Interviews  
  
- Pick the right population  
- Be prepared  
- Probe more deeply on interesting issues (focus on goals)  
  
Pros  
  
- Very good at directing next design phase  
  
Cons  
  
- Subjective (leading questions)  
- Time-consuming  
  
### Debriefing  
  
- Post-observation interviews  
  
Pros  
  
- Avoid errorneous reconstruction  
  
Cons  
  
- Time-consuming  
  
### Questionnaires, Survey  
  
- Pick **population**  
- Establish **purpose**  
- Establish **means**  
- Design questionnaires, (with debug)  
- Deliver  
  
Pros  
  
- Can reach a large population  
- As good as the questions asked (질문이 좋으면 답도 좋다)  
  
Cons  
  
- Preparation is expensive  
- Data collection can be tedious  
  
---  
  
### Closed Question  
  
Supply possible answers  
  
- Easy to analyze  
- Make it more difficult to respondent  
- Be sure to be specific  
  
→ Make sure to pick odd numbers!  
  
Ex)  
  
- Scalar (1~5) (odd number)  
- Multi-choice (Can be exclusive, or not..)  
- Ranked choice (Helpful for preference)  
  
### Open-ended Questions  
  
Answers in his or her own words  
  
- Good for general information  
- Difficult to analysis  
- Can complement closed question

## So, What is outcome?  
  
- High-level effect  
    - Taks flow problems - 흐름 상의 문제  
    - Task description problems - 제대로 설명 못한 부분?  
    - Contextual findings - 한손 사용 등 맥락적인 요소  
  
Pros  
  
- Apply to real situation  
    - Good external validity  
  
Cons  
  
- Poor internal validity  
    - Poor control of independent(predictor) variables  
- Often subject Data
